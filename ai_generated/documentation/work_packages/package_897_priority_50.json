    "4. ENHANCE (don't replace) the docstring following the template:",
    "   - Keep original docstring if it exists",
    "   - Add 'Enhanced Documentation:' section with usage patterns",
    "   - Include concrete examples with >>> syntax",
    "   - Document parameters and return values",
    "   - Note related functions and when to use vs alternatives",
    "   - Add relevant tags for searchability",
    "5. Test your examples to ensure they work",
