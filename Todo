History Entries:
	What they store:
		Document
			Text
			Cursor Position
			‹Maybe undo history?›
		Relations
			ID
			Parent ID
			‹Some way to get siblings›
		Results
			‹Printout?›
			Successfulness of command
			Time it took to run command
		Date

	Ideally it should use some kind of database, but it has to be super robust. It will replace prompt_toolkit's history implementation. It should be accessible from over the internet as well, for future purposes (but for this rp version we don't need that functionality).
