#TODO: Integrate this into RP's repl too somehow
#      when repl command finishes, we should also trigger it - not just atexit
#      Also we should be able to do this when using <c-e> -- should modify the buffer (can be undone with <c-z> as normal)
#      SHould be able to toggle this on and off globally to disable debug_eval's
#      Should be able to make it verbose or silent
#      Perhaps ask a yes/no at the end of whether we shoudl replace
#      Inform the user of what files have changed at least...ONLY IF they changed...
#      Allow a frames_back or similar option to debug_comment so other functions can build upon it, adding defaults etc.

    Modifies the source code of the file this was called in!
    Best practice is to commit all changed to git before this is called so you can revert changes.

    Notes:
        Because it simply adds or modifies # comments, the number of lines in a modified file will not be changed by this code

    EXAMPLE:
        >>> import rp

        >>> #This function modifies your code - it adds comments next to debug_comment that show what it evaluated
        >>> rp.debug_comment(rp.debug_comment)# --> <function debug_comment at 0x10717cee0>

        >>> #If you align the comments like this it will respect the alignment upon updating
        >>> rp.debug_comment(rp.debug_comment.__module__)# --> rp.experimental.debug_comment
        >>> rp.debug_comment(rp)                         # --> <module 'rp' from '/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.10/site-packages/rp/__init__.py'>
        >>> rp.debug_comment(__file__)                   # --> /Users/ryan/CleanCode/Sandbox/debugevaltest/evaltest.py
        >>> rp.debug_comment(__name__)                   # --> __main__

        >>> rp.debug_comment("What\nHappens\nWith\nMultiple\nLines")# --> 'What\nHappens\nWith\nMultiple\nLines'

        >>> #The last evaluation will be the one that's kept
        >>> for i in range(5):
        >>> rp.debug_comment(i)   # --> 4
        >>> rp.debug_comment(i**2)# --> 16

        >>> rp.debug_comment(# --> I is 4
        >>> "I is "+str(i)
        >>> )   

        >>> #This is what happens if you call it on multiple lines
        >>> rp.debug_comment(# --> 127
        >>> 123+i
        >>> )   

        >>> #If you give it a function that takes 0 args, it will try to evaluate it
        >>> #This is good for if you want to disable debug_comments and disable all the evaluation inside them too to make your code faster
        >>> rp.debug_comment(lambda: 22*22)# --> 484

        >>> #Use cases:
        >>> import torch
        >>> t=torch.randn(10,100).cpu()
        >>> rp.debug_comment(t.shape) # --> torch.Size([10, 100])
