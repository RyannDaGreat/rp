#THINGS TO DO BEFORE OFFICIAL RELEASE:
#   Rename "path" functions to "2d-somethings" idk what, but it conflicts with file-paths...
#   Rename "display" functions to "plot" functions. "display" functions should be very simple and library-agnostic, while plot can be matplotlib-based.
#   Remove useless functions, and categorize them. Probably should split into multiple files; but that's kinda messy...
#       These functions don't have to be removed from r.py, they just have to be deleted from rp.py (after using from r import *, use something like 'del useless_function')

#TODO: Turn the comments at the beginning of each function into docstrings so they can be read by the builtin help function

    A parallelized version of the built-in map using ThreadPoolExecutor.
    
    Parameters:
        - func: The function to apply to the items.
        - *iterables: Input iterables. The function is applied to the results of zipping these iterables.
        - num_threads (optional): The number of worker threads to use. 
                                 If 0, the function will work synchronously like the built-in map.
                                 If not provided, defaults to 32.
        - buffer_limit (optional): The maximum size of the buffer. Without this, this function isn't really very lazy lol.
                                   If set to 0, there's no constraint on the number of stored items and it will try to precalculate everything.
                                   A buffer_limit is useful for conserving memory, such as loading millions of images lazily in a dataloader that processes them slowly.
                                   For example, if we want to load 1,000,000 images from URLs lazily, if we don't have a buffer limit, 
                                       it will try making 1,000,000 http requests all at once - which can prevent the first ones from completing in a reasonable time.
                                       It also means you'd have to store all 1,000,000 images in memory even before you need them - which could crash your python runtime.

def ConditionalContext(condition, context_manager, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    A context manager to conditionally enter another context based on a given condition.

    This utility facilitates cleaner and concise management of conditional contexts without deep nesting.

    Parameters:
    - condition (bool or callable): A flag or a function returning a bool to determine 
      if the context should be entered.
    - context_manager (callable): A function, lambda, or class instance that returns/provides a context manager.
    - *args, **kwargs: Arguments and keyword arguments to be passed to the context_manager.

    Usage:
    ```python
    with conditional_context(some_condition, some_context, arg1, arg2, key=value):
        # Your code here...
    ```

    This usage is equivalent to the following, but with less branching and nesting:
    ```python
    if some_condition:
        with some_context(arg1, arg2, key=value):
            # Your code here...
    else:
        # Your code here... (Same as inside the context)
    ```

    The `conditional_context` streamlines the structure, making the code more readable and easier to maintain.

    Note: The context managers are instantiated and arguments are passed only if their respective conditions are True (or evaluate to True).

    Returns:
    - Context manager based on the condition.

    EXAMPLES:
    ```python
    def test_conditional_context():
        import random
        from contextlib import contextmanager

        @contextmanager
        def sample_context():
            print("Entered the context!")
            yield
            print("Exiting the context!")

        # Condition set randomly
        random_condition = random.choice([True, False])
        print(f"Random condition: {random_condition}")

        # Using conditional_context
        with conditional_context(random_condition, sample_context):
            print("Inside the conditional context.")
        print()

        # Equivalent traditional method
        if random_condition:
            with sample_context():
                print("Inside the traditional context.")
        else:
            print("Inside the traditional context.")

    #This will print the same thing twice, because it works!
    test_conditional_context()
    ```

    This test showcases how the conditional context manager works equivalently to the traditional method while providing a cleaner structure. The output for both scenarios will match, demonstrating its effectiveness.

            If text_color or background_color is given as an integer, it will be interpreted as a 256-color code.
            Any color compatible with rp.as_rgba_float_color will work too, and will be mapped to the nearest 256-color code.
            If truecolor=True, assumes terminal has 24-bit color support. Otherwise, 256 color support will be assumed.
            See the below example!

        - If link is provided, the text becomes a clickable hyperlink in terminals that support hyperlinks

    TODO: Fix bug: PROBLEM is that '\n' not in fansi('Hello\n','gray')
    This function uses ANSI escape sequnces to make colored text in a terminal.
    It can also make bolded, underlined, or highlighted text.
    It uses ANSI escape sequences to do this...
       ...and so calling it 'fansi' is a pun on 'fancy' and 'ansi'
    'fansi' is a pun, referring to ANSI and fancy
    Uses ANSI formatting to give the terminal color outputs.
    There are only 8 possible choices from each category, in ［０‚７］⋂ ℤ
    Adding 0,30,and 40 because of the ANSI codes. Subtracting 1 later on because the syntax
    of this def says that '0' is the absence of any style etc, whereas 1-8 are active styles.
    The 'per_line' option applies fansi to every line, which is useful when trying to draw tables and such
    Some terminals cant handle ansi escape sequences and just print garbage, so if _disable_fansi is turned on this function just returns unformatted text.
      (This is usually only the case with more obscure terminals, such as one I have for ssh'ing on my phone. But they do exist)
    To undo the effect of this function on a string (aka to un-format a string) use rp.strip_ansi_escapes()  (see its documentation for more details)

    """ Apply syntax highlighting to 'code', a given string of python code. Returns an ANSI-styled string for printing in a terminal. Provides extra arguments such as including line numbers, line wrapping stuff, custom styling via style_overrides, and lazy for processing super large amounts of code without having to wait for it to all finish.
        
    TODO: Because of the way it was programmed, it now included an extraneous new empty line on the top of the output. Feel free to remove that later brutishly lol (just lob it off the final output)
    If lazy==True, this function returns a generator of strings that should be printed sequentially without new lines
    If line_wrap_width is an int, it will wrap the whole output to that width - this is suprisingly tricky to do because of the ansi escape codes
    show_line_numbers, if true, will also display a line number gutter on the side

    EXAMPLE USING LAZY:
       #Lazy can make syntax highlighting of things like rp start instantly
       code=get_source_code(r)
       for chunk in fansi_syntax_highlighting(code,lazy=True,show_line_numbers=True,line_wrap_width=get_terminal_width()):
           print(end=chunk)
       print()
    The result is that it has a shorter delay to start ; but it also might take longer in total

    EXAMPLE:
       print(fansi_syntax_highlighting(get_source_code(load_image),line_wrap_width=30,show_line_numbers=False))

    Automatically accumulates and combines text copied to the clipboard.

    This function continuously monitors your clipboard for any new text that you copy.
    Run this function, then start copying text using your system clipboard. The copied text will get longer and longer.

    Whenever you copy a piece of text, it will be automatically added to a running collection
    of text items. All the accumulated text items will be combined together and copied back
    to your clipboard, allowing you to easily collect and combine multiple pieces of text.

    Parameters:
        wipe (bool, optional): If True, will clear your clipboard before running.
        unique (bool, optional): If set to True, duplicate items will be ignored.
                                 Defaults to False.

    Returns:

    Notes:
        - The function will continue running until you manually interrupt it using Ctrl+C (KeyboardInterrupt).
        - The accumulated text items will be combined using a newline character as the separator.
        - Each time a new text item is added, the updated collection will be copied back to your clipboard.

            or a color (RGB or RGBA tuple with values between 0 and 1).

        top (Union[numpy.ndarray, float, Tuple[float, float, float], Tuple[float, float, float, float]]):
            The top image to blend. Can be an image, a float (treated as a grayscale value),
            or a color (RGB or RGBA tuple with values between 0 and 1).

        alpha (Union[numpy.ndarray, float], optional): 
            The alpha mask or value to use for blending.
            If an image, it will be converted to grayscale. Where alpha is closer to 1, top will be
            more opaque. Where alpha is closer to 0, top will be more transparent and bot will show more.
            Defaults to 1.

        mode (str, optional): The blend mode to use. Can be one of:
            - "normal"   : Blends images like in Photoshop
            - "add"      : Adds pixel values of the two images
            - "multiply" : Multiplies pixel values of the two images
            - "subtract" : Subtracts pixel values of top from bot
            - "min"      : Takes the minimum pixel value from top and bot
            - "max"      : Takes the maximum pixel value from top and bot
            - "contrast" : Multiplies the bot image by top, centered at .5. 
                           Here, top can be any floating point such as > 1.0 or even -1.0 to invert the image.
            Some modes also support "clip" at the end to force pixel outputs to be between 0 and 1.
                - "add clip"
                - "multiply clip"
                - "subtract clip"
                - "contrast clip"

            These modes are inspired by photoshop. 
            NOTE:
                The specific implementation of alpha with respect to some of them is subject to change (except 'normal', that's set in stone).
                Don't rely on any blending except 'normal' mode to have a specific calculation with respect to alpha values!

            Defaults to "normal".

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The blended image.
            Will always return a float rgba image as defined by rp.is_float_image and rp.is_rgba_image

    Examples:
        Example 1: Blending multiple images
        >>> dice     ='https://bellard.org/bpg/3.png'

        >>> dice     =load_image(dice     ) #Has alpha channel
        >>> penguin  =load_image(penguin  ) #Has alpha channel
        >>> mountains=load_image(mountains) #Has no alpha channel
        >>> checkerboard=load_image(checkerboard) #Has no alpha channel
        >>> composite=blend_images(mountains,penguin,.5) #Penguin is slightly transparent
        >>> composite=blend_images(composite,dice,alpha=checkerboard) #Mix the dice on with a checkerboard mask
        >>> display_image(composite) #Result should look like https://i.imgur.com/lF8Sxuc.jpeg

        Example 2: Blending with colors and alpha
        >>> dice = 'https://bellard.org/bpg/3.png'
        >>> dice = load_image(dice)  #Has alpha channel  
        >>> display_image(blend_images((0,1,0),dice))               #Should look like https://i.imgur.com/iu6Z8bk.png

        >>> display_image(blend_images(1,1/2,alpha=dice))           #Should look like https://i.imgur.com/f0sKWY5.png

        Example 3: Numeric blending examples
        >>> blend_images(0,.5,.5)
        [[[0.25 0.25 0.25 1.  ]]]
        >>> blend_images(0,(0,1,0),.5)

        >>> blend_images(1,(0,1,0),.5)

        >>> blend_images(1,(0,1,0,.5),.5)
        [[[0.75 1.   0.75 1.  ]]]

        Example 4: Complex blending with text and blur
        >>> dog=load_image('https://i.insider.com/5484d9d1eab8ea3017b17e29?width=600&format=jpeg.jpg')
        >>> nebula=load_image('https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/nebula/en/nebula1.en.jpg')  
        >>> nebula,dog=crop_images_to_min_size(nebula,dog)
        >>> text=cv_text_to_image("OUTER\\nSPACE\\nDOGGO!!",scale=4,thickness=20)
        >>> composite=blend_images(dog,nebula,alpha=text)  
        >>> display_image(composite) #Should look like https://i.imgur.com/wEc1t8e.png
        >>> composite=blend_images(dog,nebula,alpha=cv_gauss_blur(text,sigma=15)) #Should look like https://i.imgur.com/YtPtR1p.png

        Example 5: Different blending modes
        >>> display_image(blend_images(mountains,penguin,mode='add'))     #Add mode example
        >>> display_image(blend_images(mountains,penguin,mode='multiply')) #Multiply mode example

        Example 5: Live webcam demo with multiple blend modes
        >>> lena_image = load_image(
        >>>     "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7d/Lenna_%28test_image%29.png",

    """
    A private function used by image resizing functions in rp when their interp=='auto'

    'area' interpolation is good for shrinking images
    'bilinear' interpolation is good for growing images
    This function lets you automatically choose the best interp method.
    If one dimension grows whereas the other dimension shrinks, we should use two resizings: one for 'bilinear' and the other 'area'
    
    resize_func: is expected to be an image resizing function from rp, such as rp.resize_image, rp.cv_resize_image or rp.torch_resize_image
                 it should be able to handle sizes such as (None, width) to indicate one dimension should be unchanged
                 This function is meant to be called by those functions, when the interp method is 'auto'
    image      : should be an image type compatible with rp.get_image_dimensions and the given resize_func
    new_size   : is expected to be a tuple containing two integers (height, width)

                          the distance between them is constrained by the size of full_list.
            - "independent": Perform independent sampling with replacement. Each element in full_list has an equal probability
                             of being selected in each draw, similar to drawing balls from a hat with replacement.
                             There is no guarantee of duplicates, and if present, the distance between them can be arbitrary.
                             This is the most basic possible type of sampling with replacement.

    Returns:
        A list of size batch_size containing elements sampled from full_list.

    Examples:
        >>> random_batch_with_replacement([1, 2, 3], 10, method="balanced")
        [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3]

        [3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2]  # A more typical result of this code

    - load_file (function): A function to load a single file. Expected signature: load_file(str) -> any.
    - file_paths (iterable): Paths to the files to be loaded. It's ok if this iterator is slow - paths are loaded concurrently with files.
    - num_threads (int, optional): Number of threads for concurrent loading. Defaults to 32 if set to None. If set to 0, runs on the main thread.
    - show_progress (True, False, 'eta' or 'tqdm'): Whether to show a progress bar. If set to 'tqdm', uses tqdm library. If set to 'eta', uses rp.eta. Defaults to False.
    - strict (True, False, or None): Behavior if a file fails to load. True throws an error, False skips the file, None yields None.

    Yields:
    - any or None: The content of each file, or None if the file fails to load and strict is set to None.

    This function is a generator that yields the loaded files one by one.


    TODO: This function is more powerful than the arg names and function name imply. This could be used for general-purpose parallelism with loading bars and error handling. Make a more generalized version of this function and then re-implement a shorter version of this function that uses it.
    TODO: Make a save_files version of this - big question: can a save_files function be implemented with the load_files function (and more elegantly with the above generalized version?)
    TODO: The eta can't display a specific message like "loading images" etc - it's locked to load_files right now. How can I *elegantly* allow this naming but also allow it to use tqdm?

    """
    Linearly interpolates between different values with fractional indices.
    This is written in pure python, so any values that implement addition, subtraction and multiplication will work
    (This includes floats, vectors, and even images)
    Note that linterp(values,some_integer) == values[some_integer] for any valid integer some_integer
    # Where l is a list or vector etc

    Args:
        values (list): A list of values to interpolate between. These values should support addition, subtraction, 
                       and scalar multiplication.
        index (float): The fractional index at which to interpolate. If cyclic=False, index should be in the range 
                       [0, len(values)-1]. If cyclic=True, index can be any real number and will be wrapped around 
                       to fall within the valid range.
        cyclic (bool, optional): If True, the interpolation will treat the values list as cyclic, wrapping around 
                                 from the last element back to the first. Default is False.
        blend_func (function, optional): The function used to blend between two adjacent values. Default is the 
                                         blend function, which performs a linear interpolation.
                                         
    Returns:
        The interpolated value at the specified index. The type of the returned value will match the type of the 
        elements in the values list.
        
    Raises:
        AssertionError: If index is not a number or values is not an iterable.
        IndexError: If index is out of bounds and cyclic is False.
        
    Mathematically, the interpolation is performed as follows:
        - If index is an integer i, the function returns values[i].
        - If cyclic is False:
            - The function calculates the two integer indices x0 and x1 that surround index, such that 
              x0 <= index <= x1.
            - The interpolated value is then calculated as:
              blend_func(values[x0], values[x1], (index - x0) / (x1 - x0))
        - If cyclic is True:
            - The index is first wrapped around to the range [0, len(values)] using modular arithmetic.
            - The interpolation is then performed as in the non-cyclic case, but with the values list treated as 
              cyclic (i.e., values[-1] is followed by values[0]).

    EXAMPLE: INTERPOLATING VECTORS
         >>> as_numpy_array([ linterp( as_numpy_array([[0,1], [0,0], [1,0]]), index)   for   index   in   [0, .5, 1, 1.5, 2] ])

    """
    Extracts values from a dictionary based on the variable names in the
    assignment expression in the calling line of code. 
    Mimics Javascript's destructuring assignment feature.

    The main purpose of this function is to make your code just a little shorter and less redundant.
    It compliments rp.bundle_vars and rp.gather_vars quite nicely.

    Note: This function should be considered voodoo, as it's very strange!
    It's extremely convenient though and can make your life easier.
    It can make your code less redundant, but relies on being able to find
    you source code - an assumption which doesnt always hold (for example,
    in ptpython or the default python repl. Jupyter and rp work fine though.)


    Parameters
    ----------
    d : dict
        The dictionary from which to extract values.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple or value
        A tuple of extracted values, or a single value if only one is extracted.

    Examples
    --------
        d = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}
        
        # Destructuring into multiple variables
        >>> x, y = destructure(d)
        >>> print(x, y)
        1 2

        # Destructuring into a single variable
        >>> z = destructure(d)

    Gathers the necessary positional arguments and keyword arguments to call the given function.

    This function collects the required arguments and keyword arguments for the specified function
    based on a priority ordering. It retrieves the values from the caller's scope, default values,
    and overridden values provided through *args and **kwargs.

    Priority ordering (highest to lowest):
        1. Overridden keyword arguments (**kwargs)
        2. Overridden positional arguments (*args)
        3. Varargs and varkw:
            Overridden keyword arguments' varkw variable's keyword arguments
            Overridden keyword arguments' varargs variable's positional arguments
        4. Gathered arguments and keyword arguments from the caller's scope
        5. Varargs and varkw:
            Gathered varkw variable's keyword arguments
            Gathered varargs variable's positional arguments
        6. Default arguments and keyword arguments from the function signature

    Args:
        func (callable): The function for which to gather arguments and keyword arguments.
        *args: Positional arguments to override the gathered values.
        frames_back (int, optional): The number of frames to go back in the caller's scope to gather variables. Defaults to 1.
            NOTE: frames_back will not be inferred from the environment, it's the only special keyword argument here!
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments to override the gathered values.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the gathered positional arguments and keyword arguments.
            - out_args (list): The gathered positional arguments.
            - out_kwargs (dict): The gathered keyword arguments.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If the number of positional arguments provided exceeds the number of positional arguments
                   in the function signature and the function does not have a *varargs parameter.
        TypeError: If a required argument is missing from the gathered variables and is not provided

    TODO: Use inspect.signature instead of inspect.getfullargspec, because getfullargspec is old - and functools.wrap doesn't change those signatures

    Rips a music file off of streaming sites and downloads it to the default directory…
    URL: Can take URL's from youtube, Vimeo, SoundCloud...apparently youtube_dl supports over 400 sites!!
    output_filename: Shouldn't include an extension, though IDK if it would hurt. By default the output file is saved to the default directory.
    desired_output_extension: Could be 'wav', or 'mp3', or 'ogg' etc. You have the freedom to choose the type of file you want to download regardless of the type of the original online file; it will be converted automatically (because youtube is a huge mess of file types)
      NOTE: ‘brew install ffmpeg’ (run command in terminal) is necessary for some desired_output_extension types.

    Dependency: youtube_dl  ﹙See: https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/﹚

    NOTE: youtube_dl has MANY more cool capabilities such as extracting the title/author/cover picture of the songs…
      …as well as breing able to download entire play-lists at once! youtube_dl can also rip videos; which could be very useful in another context!

      In other words, you can run them simultaneously/separately. For example:
            >>> sess1=matlab_session();sess2=matlab_session();
            >>> sess1.run_code("x=1");sess2.run_code("x=1");

    Also worth noting: You can use whatever functions you normally use in MATLAB, including .m files that you wrote and kept in your default matlab function/script saving directory.

def sync_sorted(*lists_in_descending_sorting_priority, key=None, reversed=False):
    """
    Sorts the first list and reorders all other lists to have the same order as the sorted first list.
    
    Parameters:
        *lists_in_descending_sorting_priority: One or more lists to be sorted.
                                               The first list is the main list based on which other lists will be reordered.
        key (function or list of functions, optional): A single key function or a list of key functions.
                                                       A key of None signifies the identity function - aka no key is applied.
                                                       If there's a tie in the first list, subsequent key functions can break the tie.
                                                       If 'None' is used in the list, the identity function will be used for that list.
                                                       Defaults to None, aka the identity function (lambda x: x).
        reversed (bool, optional): If set to True, sorts the lists in descending order. Defaults to False.
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple of lists sorted and reordered in sync with the first list.

    Examples:
        #TODO: Make better examples

    Alternative to Canny Edges that's more robust

    Extract edges from an image using EdgeDrawing (ED) algorithm.

    EdgeDrawing is a real-time edge detection algorithm developed by Cihan Topal and Cuneyt Akinlar.
    It works by first identifying anchor points in the image (pixels with high gradient magnitude),
    then linking these anchor points to form continuous edge segments.

    When use_parameter_free=True, it uses the Parameter-Free EdgeDrawing (PF-ED) variant, which
    automatically determines gradient and anchor thresholds from the image.

    The type of the resulting dictionary will be the same as the type of the first dictionary provided

    Args:
        *dicts: Variable length dictionary list or a single iterable of dictionaries.
        precedence (str): Determines precedence. 'first' means dictionaries listed first take precedence,
                          'last' means dictionaries listed last take precedence.
        mutate (bool): If True, the first dictionary provided will be mutated instead of creating a new one.

    Returns:
        A new dictionary that is a merge of the given dictionaries, or the first dictionary if mutate is True.

    """
    Performs either exec(code) or eval(code) and returns the result
    The code will be patched into the linecache - so you can get informative stack traces from it!
    By default it uses the scope of the caller

    The function supports directives at the top of the code block, prefixed with a '%' symbol.
    Supported directives:
        - 'return <variable_name>': Allows specifying a variable to be returned from the executed code's scope.
              This allows you to use exec code 
        - 'private_scope': Creates a private copy of the scope before executing the code for better concurrency.
        - 'prepend_code <python_expression>': Prepends some code to your command, specified by a given python expression
        - 'append_code <python_expression>': Just like like prepend_code, except the code is added to the end instead of the beginning

    Parameters:
        - code (str): The python code string to be executed or evaluated, with possible additional directive lines at the top.
        - scope (dict, optional): The scope in which to execute or evaluate the code.
                                  If not provided, the caller's scope is used.

    Returns:
        - The result of the executed or evaluated code.
          If the 'return' directive is used, the value of the specified variable is returned.

    Raises:
        - KeyError: If the 'return' directive is used and the specified variable is not found in the scope.
        - Any exception raised during the execution or evaluation of the code.

    Example (return <variable_name> directive):
        >>> code = '''
            %return z
            a = 1
            b = 2

        NOTE: If you're using linux, please use 'sudo apt-get install xclip' to let rp access your system's clipboard
        Note that you must import any modules you want to access; this terminal runs inside a def.
            If the command you enter returns a value other than None, a variable called 'ans' will be assigned that value.
        If the command you enter returns an error, pseudo_terminal will try to fix it, and if it can't it will display a summary of the error.
        To set different prompt styles, use set_prompt_style(' >> ') or set_prompt_style(' ⮤ ') etc. This currently only works with PT ON. This setting will be saved between sessions.
        To launch the debugger, type debug() on the top of your code. HINT: Typing the microcompletion '\\de' will toggleååååå this for you.
        Enter 'HISTORY' without quotes to get a list of all valid python commands you have entered so far, so you can copy and paste them into your code.
        NOTE: 
        Enter 'EPASTE' without quotes to run what is copied to your clipboard, allowing you to run multiple lines at the same time
        Enter 'MORE' without quotes to see the full error traceback of the last error, assuming the last attempted command caused an error.
        Enter 'RETURN' without quotes to end the session, and return ans as the output value of this function.
        Games: Type 'import pychess', 'import snake', 'import py2048', 'import sudoku', 'import mario', 'import tetris', or 'import flappy' (Tetris has to be fixed, its currently a big buggy)
        Enter 'CD directory/path/etc' to cd into a directory, adding it to the system path (so you can use local imports etc with RUN)
        Enter 'RUN pythonfile.py -arg1 --args --blah' to run a python file with the given args
        Enter 'PT OFF' to turn prompt-toolkit off. This saves battery life, and has less features. It's the default when using a non-tty command line
        When PT OFF, use '\\' to delete previous line of input and '/' to enter a multiline input. Yes, you can use multi-line even if PT OFF.
        Enter 'EDIT0' or 'EDIT1' etc to edit the n'th last entry in an external editor (for multiline input when PT OFF)
        Enter 'import shotgun' to attempt to pip-install a bunch of useful optional dependencies
        Note: rinsp is automatically imported into every pseudo_terminal instance; use it to debug your code really easily!
        "rinsp ans 1" is parsed to "rinsp(ans,1)" for convenience (generalized to literals etc)
        "+ 8" is parsed to "ans + 8" and ".shape" is parsed into
        play_sound_from_samples([.1,.2,.3,.4,.5,.5,.6,.6,.6,.6,.6,.6,.6,.6]*238964,3000) ⟵ Play that sound or something like it to debug speed in rp
        Sometimes, you don't have to type a command in all caps. For example, 'pwd' acts like 'PWD' if there's no variable called 'pwd'. This saves you from having to reach to the shift key. Other examples: 'tictocon'-->'TICTOC ON', 'gcon'-->'GC ON'
        Sometimes, you can use "some_variable/v" in place of "some_variable?v" when variable v doesn't exist, to save you from having to reach for the shift key. This also works for "/s"-->"?s", "/p"-->"?e" etc.
        The ?. command has some variations. r?.image will print a list of results. But, just r?. alone will enter FZF. r?.3 will enter FZF with a max search depth of 3.

    Draws a line graph using OpenCV with the given values and colors.

    Args:
        y_values (list or numpy.ndarray): The y-values of the data points.
        x_values (list or numpy.ndarray, optional): The x-values of the data points. If not provided, the indices of y_values will be used.
        height (int, optional): The height of the output image. If not provided, it will be determined based on the range of y-values.
        width (int, optional): The width of the output image. If not provided, it will be determined based on the number of data points.
        y_min (float, optional): The minimum value of the y-axis. If not provided, it will be determined based on the minimum y-value.
        y_max (float, optional): The maximum value of the y-axis. If not provided, it will be determined based on the maximum y-value.
        x_min (float, optional): The minimum value of the x-axis. If not provided, it will be determined based on the minimum x-value.
        x_max (float, optional): The maximum value of the x-axis. If not provided, it will be determined based on the maximum x-value.
        background_color (tuple, optional): The RGBA color of the background. Default is (255, 255, 255, 255) (white).
        line_color (tuple, optional): The RGBA color of the line. Default is (0, 0, 0, 255) (black).
        vertical_bar_x (float, optional): The x-coordinate of the vertical bar. If provided, a vertical bar will be drawn at this x-coordinate.
        vertical_bar_color (tuple, optional): The RGBA color of the vertical bar. Default is (255, 0, 0, 255) (red).
        antialias (bool, optional): Whether to apply antialiasing to the line. Default is True.
        thickness (int, optional): The thickness of the line. Default is 1.
        vertical_bar_thickness (int, optional): The thickness of the vertical bar. If not provided, it defaults to the thickness option.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The resulting line graph image as a uint8 HW4 image.

    Notes:
        To have multiple lines, I reccomend using rp.overlay_images and running this function multiple times with a transparent background

class CachedInstances:
    """
    TODO: Make this function smarter - use the same arg techniques as in gather_args, so even when we give overrides to default args it still caches properly. Same for memoized

    A base class that provides caching for instances of derived classes.

    The CachedInstances class is designed to cache and reuse instances of the classes
    that inherit from it. It helps prevent the creation of multiple instances with the
    same arguments, which can be useful when dealing with resource-intensive objects
    like deep learning models or other objects that require significant setup time.

    Instances are cached based on the constructor's arguments. When an object is
    requested with the same arguments as a previously created object, the cached
    instance is returned instead of creating a new one.

    A new class property, self.instance_cache, is added - you can use this to 
    clear the cache to make room for some VRAM elsewhere etc

    The cache is implemented using an rp.HandyDict, which allows for more complex keys,
    such as lists and other non-hashable types, to be used cached arguments.

    Example Use Cases:
        1. Prevent multiple connections to the same database by caching instances of a database connection class.
        2. Avoid repeating complex mathematical calculations by caching instances of a class that performs these calculations.
        3. Save time and resources by avoiding redundant machine learning model training with the caching of instances of a class that trains these models.

        class MyClass(CachedInstances):

        # Create an instance with value 42

        instance2 = MyClass(42)

        # Create an instance with value 100

        # Test that instances with the same arguments are the same object
        assert instance1 is instance2
        assert instance1 is not instance3
        assert instance2 is not instance3

    Example 2:

    Adds a label to an image and returns an image
    'size' is either measured in pixels (int), or is in proportion to the image size (float)

    Args:
        image (numpy.ndarray): The input image to be labeled.
        text (str): The text to be added as the label.
        size (int or float): The size of the label. If an integer, it represents the height of the label in pixels.
                             If a float, it represents the proportion of the label height relative to the image height.
                             If size < 0, will overlay the label over the image. Best with translucent background_color such as "translucent green"
                             Default is 15.
        position (str): The position of the label relative to the image. Can be 'top', 'bottom', 'left', or 'right'.
                        Default is 'top'.
        align (str): The alignment of the label text. Can be 'left', 'right', or 'center'. Default is 'center'.
        text_color (tuple): The color of the label text as an RGB tuple (red, green, blue). Default is white (255, 255, 255).
        background_color (tuple): The background color of the label as an RGB tuple (red, green, blue). Default is black (0, 0, 0).
        flip_text (bool): Whether to flip the label text upside down. Default is False. Can be useful when position in ['left', 'right']
        size_by_lines (bool): If True, the `size` argument is multiplied by the number of lines in the text, so it can grow accordingly
                              Good in combination with wrap_string_to_width
        font (int, str, optional): Can be an int between 0 and 8 (to use opencv) or a string (to use PIL) such as "Menlo", "Times New Roman", "Courier", "Futura", "Comic Sans", "Calibri" etc (get a bit list of available fonts with rp.get_system_fonts() )

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The image with the label added.

    r"""
    Uses PIL as an alternative backend to cv_text_to_image
    Returns an image with the given text and size and font etc

    Supports much more fonts than cv_text_to_image, which is the main appeal of this function
    
    The 'size' parameter determines the height of the output image per-line - though sometimes the height may be off by 1 or 2 pixels from the gien size

    color and background_color can be a number, an RGB float tuple, an RGBA float tuple, or a color name like 'red'

    This function uses _slow_pil_text_to_image - and somehow concatting letters is faster than using pil natively ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    #TODO: Add a recursive option, filters, etc.
    #NOTE: Sort by number is SUPER useful when you have files like [frame0,frame1,frame2...frame10,frame11,frame12...] because if you sort them alphabetically you get [frame1,frame10,frame11,...frame2,frame20,frame21...] BUT ...

    Generator that recursively yields file paths based on glob-like patterns, multi-line 
    strings, or iterables like lists and file objects. Suitable for streaming large sets 
    of file paths without loading them all into memory at once.
    
    Parameters:
        - *files: Accepts one or more glob-like patterns, multi-line strings, or iterables 
                  like lists or file objects.
        # - follow_symlinks (bool): Whether to follow symbolic links when encountered. This is 
        #                           particularly relevant when using glob patterns that are 
        #                           inherently recursive like '**/*'.
        - check_exists (bool): If True, filters out paths that don't exist. It's useful to 
                               disable this for many reasons, including that doing that can be slow.
                               Default glob.glob behaviour eliminates nonexistent files though, so:

    TODO: Finish bundling PyFlann's binaries into rp.
    FLANN is an algorithm that calculates the (approximate) nearest neigbours of a point very, very quickly. Originally called nearest_neighbor_dict, but this is ambiguous in the case that we wish to use other algorithms.
    in addition to real keys, FlannDict supports complex keys of any numpy shape. But, just try to be consistent else it will throw errors (by design).
    This is abstraction above FLANN that lets you use nearest neighbor search with the interface of a dictionary; automatically rebuilding the index as needed (for a huge performance boost).
    This interface can be replaced by a brute force search...but why do that?
    FlannDict caches any queries you make, so if you query the same point twice it will just reuse those calculations. This cache is automatically reset upon rebuilding the FLANN tree.
    Uses nearest-neighbor to match keys. Currently uses FLANN.
    Use splicing to get k nearest neighbours like this: d[point:k] (will return a list with k nearest neighbours.) K must be >=0.
    nn stands for nearest neighbor, and knn stands for 'k nearest neighbours'
    Example:
     >>> n=FlannDict()
     >>> n[[0,0,0,0]]='Hello!'
     >>> n[[1,0,0,0]]='First!'
     >>> n[[0,1,0,0]]='Second!'
     >>> n[[0,0,1,0]]='Third!'
     >>> n[[0,0,0,1]]='Fourth!'
    
     >>> n[[0,0,799,75]]

     >>> n[[0,0,0]]
     ERROR: AssertionError: Wrong key shape! key.shape==(3,) but self._key_shape==(4,)
    
     >>> n[[0,0,7,75]]
     ans = Fourth!

Secondly, assuming it's a closed path with no self-intersections, it's accurate to say that a 179 degree turn is very different from a -179 degree turn, because an exact 180 degree turn is impossible (it would imply the curve self-intersects), and that one degree difference determines the direction of the next points on the curve (because they can't self-intersect.)

    EXAMPLE APPLICATION:
       http://www.cs.unc.edu/~lazebnik/research/spring08/faces.jpg
       Look at that picture. You'll see an array of 10*10 faces. We need to pre-process this image to extract the individual faces.
       output=split_tensor_into_regions(‹that image›,10,10,flat=False)  (it doesn't matter if the image is RGB or not, it can handle either case)
       Then, output[0,0] is the upper left face, and output[0,1] is one-to-the-right of the top left image
       Also, output[1,:] is a list of all the faces on the second row ([face1,face2,face3...])
       But maybe we want to do PCA on all these images. We don't want to address these faces by coordinate anymore; we want to get rid of that information.
       We just want one big flattened list of faces. To do this, we would instead use
       output=split_tensor_into_regions(‹that image›,10,10,flat=True)
       This would give us a list of numpy arrays containing every face in the image, such that output[35] would exist (and, because it's a 10x10 faces image, give us the 5th face on the third row (taking into account starting at the 0th index))

    Downloads a YouTube video based on the given URL or video ID. The function can selectively download video only, 
    audio only, or both depending on the parameters. All downloads are currently as mp4 or webm files.

    NOTE: If it doesn't work, try "pip install pytubefix --upgrade"

    If need_audio is True, we might only download the audio file (or might download a video with audio)
    If need_video is True, we might download a video without audio (potentially at much higher resolution)
    If both are True, it tends to only download at 360p (aka video height=360).

    Parameters:
        - url_or_id (str): The YouTube video URL or video ID.
        - path (str, optional): The destination path where the video/audio will be saved. If not provided,
                                The path will be:    ./<YouTubeVideo Title>.mp4   or   .webm
                                Where <YouTubeVideo Title> is the video title as displayed on the website
                                Right now it must be an mp4 or webm file if specified manually, according to the filetype arg!
        - need_video (bool, optional): If set to True, downloads the video track. Defaults to True.
        - need_audio (bool, optional): If set to True, downloads the audio track. If False and `need_video` is True,
                                       downloads video only without audio. Defaults to True.
                                       NOTE: Setting this to False allows for higher resolution videos! This is because 
                                           YouTube normally streams both separately, and the ones that have both tend to be smaller files. 
                                           If you need high resolution and audio, I reccomend using rp.add_audio_to_video_file and using this function twice:
                                           once for audio-only and once for video-only, and use that function to patch the audio into the video-only file.
        - max_resolution (int, optional): The maximum resolution allowed for the video. Defaults to None. Only matters if need_video
        - min_resolution (int, optional): The minimum resolution required for the video. Defaults to None. Only matters if need_video
        - resolution_preference (callable, optional): A function to determine the preferred resolution from available options. Only matters if need_video
                                                      (Different youtube videos have different resolutoin options)
                                                      It will be passed a sorted list of integers, such as [144, 240, 360, 720, 1080] etc
                                                      These correspond to 144p, 240p, 360p etc - and refer to the minimum(height, width) of a video
                                                      In other words, 720P for a vertical video means the video has 720-pixel width, and 720p for a landscape video means it has 720-pixel height
                                                      Defaults to max, which selects the highest available resolution.
        - skip_existing (bool, optional): If set to True, skips downloading if the file already exists at the destination path. Defaults to False.
        - show_progress (bool, optional): If set to True, will show download progress over time. Defaults to True.
        - overwrite (bool, optional): If set to True, overwrites the existing file at the destination path. Defaults to False.
                                      If False, and the output path already exists, it will create a new non-conflicting path
                                      like some_video_copy.mp4 or some_video_copy2.mp4 etc
        - filetype (str, optional): Specifies the type of video file we will attempt to download. Can be either 'mp4' or 'webm'

    Returns:
        - str: The path to the downloaded MP4 file (which might contain just video, just audio or both)

    Note:
        - Current backend library: pytubefix. This might change in the future, but the black-box specification of download_youtube_video should always remain the same.

    Converts a video file to a GIF using FFmpeg.

    TODO: Investigate the framerate arg. It sometimes skips frames! And doesn't always seem to give the framerate I ask of it.

    Args:
        video_path (str): The path to the input video file.
        output_path (str, optional): The path where the output GIF will be saved. If not provided, 
            a unique output path will be generated based on the input video's path with the '.gif' extension.
        framerate (int, optional): The desired framerate for the GIF. Default is None, meaning it will inherit the input video file's framerate.
        custom_palette (bool, optional): Whether to use a custom palette for higher quality but larger file size.
            If True, a temporary palette file will be generated and used for the GIF conversion.
            If False, the GIF will be converted without using a custom palette, resulting in a smaller file size
            but potentially lower quality. Default is True.
        show_progress (bool, optional): Whether to suppress FFmpeg output. If False, FFmpeg will run in quiet mode.
            Default is False.

    Returns:
        str: The path to the generated GIF file.

    Learned how to do this from here: https://steemit.com/programming/@makerhacks/how-to-get-higher-quality-gifs-with-ffmpeg

    Note: FFMPEG might choose the frame delays on a per-frame basis, making it jerky if viewed at a low framerate! You can fix this with 
        rp.save_animated_gif(rp.convert_to_gif_via_ffmpeg(video), framerate=12)

def roll_image(image, dx=0, dy=0, interp='nearest'):

    Shifts/rolls an image by the specified displacement in x and y directions.

    NOTE:
        It uses image coordinates, so a positive dx moves the image to the right
        But a positive dy moves the image down!
    
    This function supports different interpolation methods for non-integer shifts:
    - 'nearest': Uses the nearest integer shift
    - 'bilinear': Uses bilinear interpolation for sub-pixel accuracy
    - 'round': Rounds displacement to nearest integer
    - 'floor': Floors displacement to integer
    - 'ceil': Ceils displacement to integer
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : numpy.ndarray
        Input image in HWC format (Height x Width x Channels)
    dx : float
        Displacement in x direction (positive moves right)
    dy : float
        Displacement in y direction (positive moves down)
    interp : str, optional
        Interpolation method ('nearest', 'bilinear', 'round', 'floor', 'ceil')
        Default is 'nearest'
        
    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Shifted image with same shape as input. If using bilinear, output will be floating point.

    Given some big image that is surrounded by black, or 0-alpha transparency, crop out that excess region
    Crops out black or fully transparent (0-alpha) regions from the borders of an image.
    
    This function removes excess black borders or regions of zero-alpha transparency around an image, reducing it to only the visible content. It can return either the cropped image or the bounding coordinates of the cropped area.

    Parameters:
        image : ndarray
            The input image to crop, which can be grayscale, RGB, or RGBA.
        output : str, optional
            Specifies the type of output to return. If 'image' (default), returns the cropped image.
            If 'bounds', returns a tuple of bounding box coordinates (top, bottom, left, right).

    Returns:
        cropped_image : ndarray
            The cropped image, returned if output is 'image'.
        bounds : tuple of int
            A tuple (top, bottom, left, right) defining the bounding box coordinates, returned if output is 'bounds'.

    TODO: provide a visual example
    The way OpenCV extracts single-pixel-wide non-looping contours is to treat those contours as loops, where the second half of the points are just the first-half of the points mirrored
    If we want to find the start/end points of a segment, we need to find the two points of symmetry (which are visually obvious, but its not a given that they exist such as if we have a T-junction)
    We do this by autocorrelating the contour with it's mirrored self (AKA the reverse of the contour) to find the shift of the reverse that best matches the original contour. This is equivalent to auto-convolving the contour with itself. We will get two minima, but we only need one. The second symmetry point should be exactly half-way down that contour.
    For example: a contour created by opencv's find contours might look like [[1,1],[[2,2]],[[3,3]],[[4,4]],[[3,3]],[[2,2]]] but obviously we just want [[[1,1]],[[2,2]],[[3,3]],[[4,4]]] and to discard the duplicates. That's what cv_contour_to_segment does.
    This function can be used to get the starting and end points of the segment, which is a bit of a tricky problem.
    The output of a contour given to this function should have half the original length.
    WARNING: This function doesn't check to see if the contour you gave it is actually a segment; be careful! You can usually check to see if a contour is a segment (if using cv_find_contours) by seeing if contour.is_solid_white is True (AKA if the contour doesn't enclose any non-white,area)

    Splits the input text into sentences based on the specified language.

    This function uses the Punkt tokenizer, which is an unsupervised machine learning
    algorithm for sentence tokenization developed by Kiss and Strunk. It effectively
    segments text into sentences based on punctuation and capitalization cues. The Punkt
    tokenizer is part of the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library in Python.

    The function is designed to work with multiple languages:
        'english'
        'spanish'
        'french'
        'italian'
        'german'
        'russian'

        'malayalam'
        'norwegian'
        'danish'
        'turkish'
        'polish'

    To see the full list of supported languages and their corresponding codes, run the following code snippet:
        print(rp.r._get_punkt_languages())

    Parameters:
        text (str): The input text to be split into sentences.
        language (str): The langauge to be split

    Returns:
        list: A list of sentences extracted from the input text.

    Example:
        text = "Hello! This is an example of splitting sentences. How are you doing today?"
        sentences = split_sentences(text)
        print(sentences)
        # Output: ['Hello!', 'This is an example of splitting sentences.', 'How are you doing today?']

    Alternative Libraries:
        An alternative library for sentence tokenization is spaCy, which provides a more comprehensive
        natural language processing pipeline and supports a wide range of languages. If you need more advanced
        NLP capabilities or prefer a different tokenizer, consider using the spaCy library.

        url (str or any): Typically a url. Input based on which the hash for the file name is generated.
            It can also be any object compatible with rp.object_to_bytes - doesn't stictly have to be a url.
        cache_dir (str, optional): Directory for storing cached files. Defaults to system's temporary directory.
        file_extension (str, optional): The file extension of the output path. If none, is inferred automatically.
        hash_func (callable, optional): Function to compute hash of `url`. Uses SHA-256 with a prefix by default.

    Returns:
        str: Full path to the cache file, incorporating directory, hashed file name, and extension.

    Example:
        >>> get_cache_file_path("example_data", cache_dir="/tmp", file_extension=".txt")
        '/tmp/rp_cache_<hashcode>.txt'

        >>> #Load the image from a url, caching it to your harddrive for extra speed - persistently between python processes
        >>> image = load_image(download_url_to_cache('https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/536/354'))

    Works for strings, lists and tuples (and possibly other datatypes, but not numpy arrays)
    This implementation is two orders of magnitude faster than anything I could find on the web/stack overflow/etc, especially for strings
    It has complexity O(len(output of this function)), and a very good time constant (because it doesn't directly iterate through every element in a python loop)
    On my computer, this function was able to compare two strings of length 1,000,000 in 0.00454 second. Here's the test I used: string='a'*10**7;tic();longest_common_prefix(string,string);ptoc() [[[tic() starts a timer, ptoc() prints out the elapsed time]]]
    
    EXAMPLES:
       longest_common_prefix('abcderty','abcdefoaisjd')                --> abcde
       longest_common_prefix('abcderty','abcsdefoa')                   --> abc
       longest_common_prefix('abcderty','asbcsdefoa')                  --> a
       longest_common_prefix('abcderty','aasbcsdefoa')                 --> a
       longest_common_prefix('aaaabdcderty','aasbcsdefoa')             --> aa
       longest_common_prefix(list('aaaabdcderty'),list('aasbcsdefoa')) --> ['a', 'a']

    """
    If handle_keyboard_interrupt is True, when you press control+c, it will return the control+c character instead of throwing a KeyboardInterrupt
    Blocks the code until you press some key on the keyboard
    Returns the characters sent to a terminal after you press that key
    Original code from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/983354/how-do-i-make-python-wait-for-a-pressed-key
    Note that when arrow keys are pressed, for example, more than one character might be sent - and it might vary depending on your terminal.
    EXAMPLE: for _ in range(10): print(repr(input_keypress()))
    EXAMPLE: Piano:
        print("Press keys qwertyui to play music!")
        major_scale=[0,2,4,5,7,9,11,12]
        while True:
            index='qwertyui'.index(input_keypress())#Intentionally, this will break the loop if we press a wrong key
            print(index)
            play_chord(major_scale[index],t=.25)

    Waits for a single keypress on stdin.

    This is a silly function to call if you need to do it a lot because it has
    to store stdin's current setup, setup stdin for reading single keystrokes
    then read the single keystroke then revert stdin back after reading the
    keystroke.

    Returns a tuple of characters of the key that was pressed - on Linux, 
    pressing keys like up arrow results in a sequence of characters. Returns 
    ('\x03',) on KeyboardInterrupt which can happen when a signal gets
    handled.

#Ryan Burgert's Tmux config
#Main changes:
#   * Note: These shortcuts are all preceded by Control+B
#   - You can use the mouse to move panes around
#   - The history limit is way higher than the default
#   - Ctrl+S toggles the visibility of the status bar
#   - Let Control-HJKL (with shift key) resize panes
#   - Changing the leader (useful in nested sessions):
#       - NOTE: To activate this, uncomment the section titled CHANGING THE LEADER
#       - Alt+a sets the leader to Alt+B 
#       - Control+A sets the leader to Control+B
#   - Vim-like bindings have been added:
#       - hjkl for pane navigation
#       - When in copy move (after ctrl+b then [), use 'v' to start a selection then 'y' to yank it
#           - When this selection is yanked, it's sent to your system clipboard, which means you can paste it again somewhere else (i.e. sublime text, for example). NOTE: On Linux, please install 'sudo apt install xclip' to make this work!)
#   - Reordering tabs
#       - N and P move the current tab right and left, respectively
#   - Use capital C to create new window with same directory as current pane (as opposed to lower-case c)

def get_sinusoidal_positional_encodings(length: int, dim: int, scale: float = 10000.0) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Generate sinusoidal position encodings for transformer models.
    
    Parameters:
        length: int
            Length of the sequence.
        dim: int
            Dimension of the model (embedding dimension).
        scale: float, optional
            Scaling factor for the frequencies, by default 10000.0¹
    
    Returns:
        np.ndarray
            Position encoding matrix of shape (length, dim).
    
    Notes:
        The position encoding uses sine for even indices and cosine for odd indices
        in the embedding dimension, with frequencies decreasing as the dimension increases.
        
        ¹ The value 10000 comes from the original "Attention is All You Need" paper by 
        Vaswani et al. (2017), Section 3.5 "Positional Encoding", page 6. The paper 
        states: "We use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies... 
        where pos is the position and i is the dimension." The specific value 10000 
        appears in equation (5) as a scaling factor that determines how quickly the 
        frequencies decrease across embedding dimensions. While the paper doesn't 
        explicitly justify why 10000 was chosen, it has become the standard in transformer 
        implementations. Paper link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf

    Launches VisiData to view and potentially edit a file or data object.

    Behavior:
        - If `target` is a string representing a file path and the file exists, VisiData opens the file directly.
        - If `target` is a data object, it is first converted into a pandas DataFrame, then saved to a temporary CSV file which VisiData opens.

    Important:
        - Changes made in VisiData can be saved back to the original DataFrame or file by pressing Ctrl+S before exiting VisiData.

    """
    Remap an image tensor using the given x and y coordinate tensors.
    Out-of-bounds regions will be given 0's
    Analagous to rp.cv_remap_image, which is used for images as defined by rp.is_image()
    
    If the image is RGBA, then out-of-bounds regions will have 0-alpha.
    This is like a UV mapping - where x and y's values are mapped to the image.
    If relative=True, it will warp the image - treating x and y like dx and dy.
        Note: Because this is a mapping, the direction of movement will be opposite dx and dy - so you may need to negate them!

    If add_alpha_mask=True, an additional alpha channel full of 1's will be concatenated to the input image tensor.
    This alpha channel will become 0 for out-of-bounds regions after remapping, serving as an indicator for invalid regions.

    Args:
        image (torch.Tensor): Input image tensor of shape [C, H, W], where C is the number of channels (e.g., 3 for RGB, 4 for RGBA),
                              H is the height, and W is the width of the image.
        x (torch.Tensor): X-coordinate tensor of shape [H_out, W_out] specifying the x-coordinates for remapping,
                          where H_out is the output height and W_out is the output width.
        y (torch.Tensor): Y-coordinate tensor of shape [H_out, W_out] specifying the y-coordinates for remapping.
        relative (bool, optional): If True, treat x and y as deltas (dx and dy) and perform relative warping. Default is False.
        interp (str, optional): Interpolation method. Can be one of 'bilinear', 'bicubic', or 'nearest'. Default is 'bilinear'.
        add_alpha_mask (bool, optional): If True, an additional alpha channel full of 1's will be concatenated to the input image tensor. Default is False.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Remapped image tensor.
            - If add_alpha_mask=False, the output shape is [C, H_out, W_out], where:
                - C is the number of channels in the input image.
                - H_out is the output height.
                - W_out is the output width.
            - If add_alpha_mask=True, the output shape is [C+1, H_out, W_out], where:
                - C+1 includes the additional alpha channel.
                - H_out is the output height.
                - W_out is the output width.

        0. Original use-case (fancier):
            >>> H, W, C = rp.validate_shapes(
            ...     #Instead of rp.destructure, we can also do this to be more pythonic
            ...     'H W C',
            ...     
            ...     #The tensors we want to check
            ...     video ='PT PH PW 3',
            ...     mask  ='PT PH PW',
            ...     tracks='PT N XY',
            ...
            ...     **rp.gather_vars('PT PH PW PT N XY'), #Manually specify existing dims
            ...
            ...     verbose='bold yellow', #Format the printout with fansi
            ... )

        1. Basic usage - extract dimensions:
            >>> img = torch.zeros(224, 224, 3)
            >>> dims = validate_tensor_shapes(img="H W C")
            >>> dims.H  # 224
            >>> dims.W  # 224
            >>> dims.C  # 3
        
        2. Check that multiple tensors share dimensions:
            >>> img = torch.zeros(224, 224, 3)
            >>> mask = torch.zeros(224, 224, 1) 
            >>> dims = validate_tensor_shapes(img="H W C", mask="H W 1")
            # This passes because H and W are the same in both
            
            # This would FAIL because the heights don't match:
            >>> img = torch.zeros(224, 224, 3)
            >>> mask = torch.zeros(256, 224, 1)
            >>> validate_tensor_shapes(img="H W C", mask="H W 1")
            ValueError: [detailed error showing H=224 vs H=256]
        
        3. Enforce specific dimension values:
            >>> img = torch.zeros(224, 224, 3)
            >>> validate_tensor_shapes(img="H W 3")  # Passes, requires channel dim to be exactly 3
            >>> img = torch.zeros(224, 224, 4)
            >>> validate_tensor_shapes(img="H W 3")  # FAILS with clear error message
        
        4. Set dimension values manually:
            >>> img = torch.zeros(224, 224, 3)
            >>> dims = validate_tensor_shapes(img="H W C", C=5)  # Fail! C=3 in img but we set C=5
        
        5. Works with any object that has a shape attribute (torch, numpy, etc.):
            >>> numpy_array = np.zeros((224, 224, 3))
            >>> dims = validate_tensor_shapes(numpy_array="H W C")
            
        6. Validate tensor types with numpy: and torch: prefixes:
            >>> numpy_array = np.zeros((224, 224, 3))
            ... torch_tensor = torch.zeros(32, 10)
            ... # This passes - tensors match their expected types
            ... validate_tensor_shapes(
            ...     torch_tensor="torch: B D",     # Expects a torch tensor
            ...     numpy_array="numpy: H W C"     # Expects a numpy array
            ... )
            ... 
            ... # This would FAIL - wrong tensor types
            ... validate_tensor_shapes(
            ...     torch_tensor="numpy: B D",     # torch_tensor is not a numpy array
            ...     numpy_array="torch: H W C"     # numpy_array is not a torch tensor
            ... )
            ValueError: [detailed error showing type mismatches]

    Scatter add an image tensor using the given x and y coordinate tensors.
    Pixels warped out-of-bounds will be skipped.
    This is similar to torch_remap_image, but uses scatter_add instead of remapping.
    
    If relative=True, it will treat x and y as deltas (dx and dy) and perform relative scatter adding.
        Note: Because this is a scatter operation, the direction of movement will be the same as dx and dy.

    Args:
        image (torch.Tensor): Input image tensor of shape [C, H, W], where C is the number of channels (e.g., 3 for RGB, 4 for RGBA),
                              H is the height, and W is the width of the image.

                          where H_in is the input height and W_in is the input width.
        y (torch.Tensor): Y-coordinate tensor of shape [H_in, W_in] specifying the y-coordinates for scatter adding.
        relative (bool, optional): If True, treat x and y as deltas (dx and dy) and perform relative scatter adding. Default is False.
        interp (str, optional): Specifies how to handle fractional coordinates. Can be one of 'bilinear' (the slowest one), 'floor' (the fastest one), 'ceil', or 'round'. Default is 'floor'.
        height (int, optional): The output height. If not specified, it is inferred from the input image height.
        width (int, optional): The output width. If not specified, it is inferred from the input image width.
        prepend_ones (bool, optional): If True, prepends a channel of ones to the input tensor before calculation. Useful for getting the sum easily by accessing output[0]. This option is simply for convenience. Default is False.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Scatter added image tensor of shape [C, H_out, W_out] or [C+1, H_out, W_out] if prepend_ones is True, where:
            - C is the number of channels in the input image.

def accumulate_flows(*flows,reduce=True,reverse=False):
    """
    Accumulates a sequence of flows into a single flow or a sequence of accumulated flows.

    A flow is a 2HW aka [XY]HW tensor, either torch or numpy
    And therefore, flows is its plural: T2HW aka T[XY]HW

    Parameters
    ----------
    flows : numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor or list of numpy.ndarray or list of torch.Tensor
        A 4D tensor in T2HW aka T[XY]HW form, representing a sequence of flows.
        Each flow is a 2D tensor of shape (2, H, W), where the first dimension
        represents the x and y components of the flow vectors.

        The function supports the following input formats:
        - numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor: shape (T, 2, H, W).
        - list of numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor: A list, each of shape (2, H, W).

    reduce : bool, optional
        If True (default), returns a single accumulated flow of shape (2, H, W).
        If False, returns a sequence of accumulated flows of shape (T, 2, H, W).

    reverse : bool, optional
        False by default
        If True, calculates the reverse cumulative flow. Useful for remap operations. See cv_optical_flow's docstring for a realtime example of this.
        Definition:
            accumulate_flows(flows, reverse=True) ==== -accumulate_flows(-flows[::-1])

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor
        If `reduce` is True, returns a single accumulated flow in 2HW aka [XY]HW form,
        If `reduce` is False, returns a sequence of accumulated flows in T2HW aka T[XY]HW form,
        The output type/dtype/device format matches the input flows with the same height/width as the inputs

    NOTES:
        The math behind this can be tricky if accumulating for a remap operation! Please see the real-life example in this docstring.
        There's really only one correct way to do it, and you have to understand it.

    EXAMPLE:
        (See rp.cv_optical_flow's docstring's example for a realtime webcam demo!)

    EXAMPLE (shapes):
        >>> flows = np.random.rand(5, 2, 100, 100)  # 5 flows of shape (2, H, W)
        >>> accumulated_flow = accumulate_flows(flows)
        >>> accumulated_flow.shape
        (2, 100, 100)

        >>> flows = [torch.rand(2, 100, 100) for _ in range(5)]  # 5 flows of shape (2, H, W)
        >>> accumulated_flows = accumulate_flows(flows, reduce=False)
        >>> accumulated_flows.shape

def cv_inpaint_image(image, mask=None, radius=3, *, algorithm: str = "TELEA", invert_mask=False):
    """
    Inpaint an image using OpenCV's inpainting methods.
    The inpainting will be super smooth, and does not use any machine learning

    Parameters:
        - image: The input image to be inpainted, expected to be in RGB format with byte values.
        - mask: A binary mask indicating the regions to inpaint. Must be the same size as `image`.
                If left as None, the inverted alpha channel of image will be used (rounded to a binary mask)
                Like OpenCV, where the mask is True, it will be inpainted. Where it is False, the original image is returned.
        - radius: The radius of a circular neighborhood of each point to inpaint. Defines how far the inpainting method 
          can reach for information while inpainting. Larger values consider more of the surrounding pixels. Default is 3.
        - algorithm: The inpainting method to use. Can be "TELEA" or "NS". Default is "TELEA".
          "TELEA" uses the method by Alexandru Telea [An Image Inpainting Technique Based on the Fast Marching Method].
          "NS" uses the method by Bertalmio, Marcelo, Andrea L. Bertozzi, and Guillermo Sapiro [Navier-Stokes, Fluid Dynamics, and Image and Video Inpainting].

    Search and Replace text in files
    This function searches for all text files within the given paths and replaces all instances of the query string with the replacement string.
    It has two modes of operation: non-interactive and interactive. In non-interactive mode, the function will automatically replace all instances of the query string with the replacement string in all text files within the given paths. In interactive mode, the function will prompt the user before making changes to each file, allowing them to preview the changes, skip the file, or make changes to all remaining files.

    Parameters:
    query (str): The string to search for
    replacement (str): The string to replace the query with
    paths (str or list of str): The file or folder path(s) to search for text files. If a folder is provided, all text files within that folder and its subfolders will be processed recursively.
    interactive (bool): Whether to prompt the user before making changes

    """
    Returns the appropriate PyTorch device based on the available hardware and system configuration.
    
    This function selects the best device for running PyTorch operations based on the user's
    hardware, OS, and settings. It supports GPU devices if available and falls back to CPU if
    needed. The function also supports Macs with MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) and
    allows for GPU cycling to balance workload across multiple GPUs.
    
    The function selects the GPU with the nth highest available VRAM. In the case of ties for VRAM
    availability, GPUs are considered in the order of their IDs, and n determines which of the tied
    GPUs will be selected. If n >= number of available GPUs, the function wraps around using
    modulus, cycling through the available GPUs.

    Args:
        n (int, optional): The index of the GPU to select based on available VRAM (zero-based). Defaults to 0.
        silent (bool, optional): If True, suppresses print statements. Defaults to False.
        prefer_used (bool, optional): If True, selects a GPU already in use by the current
            process if available. Defaults to False.
        reserve (bool, optional): If True, will reserve the GPU for future usage - by allocating a small amount of VRAM
            It requires the filelock library, which will be used to prevent other processes from claiming the same GPU at the same time

    Returns:
        torch.device: The selected PyTorch device ('cpu', 'mps', or 'cuda:<gpu_id>').
        
    Examples:
        - If you have 4 GPUs with free VRAMs [200, 0, 100, 100] and you select n=0, you will get 'cuda:1'.
        - If you select n=1, you will get 'cuda:2', as it's the GPU with the second highest free VRAM.
        - If you select n=2, you will get 'cuda:3', and if you select n=3, you get 'cuda:0' and so on.
        - If you select n=5, you will get 'cuda:1' again, as it cycles through the available GPUs.

    Edge Cases:
        - If running on a Mac without MPS support, the function falls back to CPU.
        - If no GPUs are available, the function selects the CPU.
        - If n >= number of available GPUs, the function cycles through the available GPUs
          and selects one based on the index n % number of GPUs.
        - If prefer_used is set and no GPUs are currently in use by the process, the function
          selects an available GPU based on the index n.
        - If prefer_used is set and there are GPUs currently in use by the process, the function
          will select from those GPUs.

    Example (reserve):
        Put this in torch_device_selector.py:
            from rp import *
            import torch
            sleep(random_float(0))
            device=select_torch_device(reserve=True)
            torch.zeros(1).to(device)
            sleep(10)
            print("SELECTED",device)

        Then run this shell command (adjust the number of lines to your number of GPU's):
            python torch_device_selector_test.py &
            python torch_device_selector_test.py &
            python torch_device_selector_test.py &

            python torch_device_selector_test.py &
            python torch_device_selector_test.py

        Because of reserve's use of the 'filelock' library, they won't clobber each other
        Each GPU will be reserved once, by a different process

    This function calculates the interpolation weights for each query point based
    on the Delaunay triangulation of the data points.

    Args:
        key_points (np.array): A 2d array of data points for Delaunay triangulation.
        query_points (np.array): A 2d array of query points to be interpolated,
                                 or a single 1d vector query point. Note: if 
                                 query_points.ndim==1, then the outputs of this 
                                 function are no longer 2d, and will be 1d instead.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing two arrays, one with the indices of the vertices
               for each simplex and another with the corresponding weights for
               interpolation. 
    Note:

        For repeated calls with the same key points, it's more efficient to reuse 
        a Delaunay object than to recreate it each time due to the costly nature 
        of Delaunay triangulation. If that is your use case, modify this function.
        
    Example:
       >>> delaunay_interpolation_weights(np.random.randn(100,2), np.random.rand(3,2))
        ans=(
               [[ 4, 50, 28],

    TODO: Make this function only request sudo if we need it. Otherwise it's a nuisance.
    TODO: Add an "always" option to "yes" and "no" for installing modules.

    Attempts to import a module, and if successful returns it.
    If it's unsuccessful, it attempts to find it on pypi, and if
       it can, it asks you if you'd like to install it, and if
       you say 'yes', rp will attempt to install it for you.
    Note: There are some cases where it won't ask you, and instead will just go ahead and install the packages needed
      - If you're in Google Colab, it won't ask before installing packages as needed

    The rp module uses tons and tons of packages from pypi.
    You don't need to install all of them to make rp work,
       because not all functions need all of these packages.
    However, when you DO need a certain package's module,
       and we try importing it, we get an import error.
    Normally, this isn't a problem, because most packages on pypi
       have the same package name as the module name.
    For example: 'pip install rp' allows 'import rp', because the pypi-name
       and the import name are the same thing.
    Some modules break this rule though. For example, opencv:
       opencv is installed with 'pip install opencv-python' and imported like 'cv2=pip_import('cv2')'.
    Obviously, "cv2"!="opencv-python". And because of this, when you get an error "can't cv2=pip_import('cv2')",
       you can't just fix it with 'pip install cv2'. You have to google it. That's annoying.
    THIS FUNCTION addresses that problem. pip
