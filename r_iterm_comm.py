# Getting variables to be shared between modules can be difficult.
# This class exists so that modules from r.py can talk to modules in the rp_ptpython package.
# Essentially, this class is th middle-man. The other modules will both read and write to this module.
# This module is pretty hacky...but that's OK. It doesn't really respect nested pseudoterminals though, so if we were to make multiple async pseudoterminals this module couldn't exist.
